# ü•© Steak Timer App

A fun and interactive **React + TypeScript** single-page application that helps you time your steak cooking perfectly! This project is built with **Vite** for fast development and uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. It also comes with testing support using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User-Friendly Timer:**  
  Input your desired steak cut, doneness level, and thickness (in cm) to automatically calculate the ideal cooking time.

- **Dynamic Steak Visualization:**  
  A gradient square visualizes the steak's doneness transition from red/pink (raw) to brown (cooked) from the top and bottom.

- **Interactive Controls:**  
  - **Start Timer:** Begin the cooking countdown.
  - **Pause/Resume:** Pause or resume the timer.
  - **Stop:** Cancel the timer and reset inputs.
  - The app automatically displays prompts to "Flip Your Steak Now" at the halfway mark, and shows a finished message when done.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Optimized for mobile with vertically aligned dropdowns.

- **Strong Type Safety:**  
  Uses TypeScript with custom enums for `Doneness` and `Cut`.

- **Testing:**  
  Comprehensive tests written with Vitest and React Testing Library ensure the app behaves as expected.
